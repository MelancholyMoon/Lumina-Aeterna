# Lumina Aeterna
Lumina Aeterna is an open-source, open-world bullet-hell RPG with 2D pixel art. The game follows the journey of a cultist who crashes on Earth. Humanity is gone, and instead it will encounter bizarre creatures, some friendly, some not. Explore ruined cities, collect powerful relics, and survive fast-paced real time combat with many projectiles and unique abilities.

The repository is currently almost empty because the project is still a WIP (Work In Progress). Real‑time changes and all files are kept in a private repository until the first release. If you want to learn more, you can join the official Project Lumina Discord server:

## Project Lumina

**Project Lumina** is the name of the narrative universe behind which we are developing multiple pieces of content and products. Project Lumina is an open project for everyone. Anyone can take part, provided they give credit to the creators, to the project itself, and, where applicable, to any products already developed, can make fan-made content and release it as part of the Project Lumina universe. We also plan to launch an official public wiki where anyone can request to add their own creations, characters and stories.

**Lumina Aeterna** is an official Project Lumina product, consequently, the events, characters, species, universe, and the content are connected to Project Lumina and may appear again in other Project Lumina products.

## How to download the game

The game can be downloaded in two ways:

1. **Official method** — Buy or download the game from Steam or Itch.io. A free demo is also available on those platforms and in the Releases section on GitHub. Downloading the demo does **not** give you a license to download or modify the source code using the **Source method**.

2. **Source method** — Download the project source code from this repository and export the game with Godot 4.4 (or play it straight from the engine). To legally use this method you must **own a valid license** obtained buying the game via the **Official method**. See the **EULA** for details.

Use the Official method to get the original, fully supported Lumina Aeterna experience, unlock achievements, and eventually use Steam features. Use the Source method if you want to modify the game, create mods, or build a custom version. Make sure your use **follows the license and EULA**.
