# Lumina Aeterna
Lumina Aeterna is an open-source, open-world bullet-hell RPG with 2D pixel art. The game follows the journey of a cultist who crashes on Earth. Humanity is gone, and instead it will encounter bizarre creatures, some friendly, some not. Explore ruined cities, collect powerful relics, and survive fast-paced real time combat with many projectiles and unique abilities.

The repository is currently almost empty because the project is still a WIP (Work In Progress). Real‑time changes and all files are kept in a private repository until the first release. If you want to learn more, you can join the official Project Lumina Discord server:

## Project Lumina

**Project Lumina** is the name of the narrative universe behind which we are developing multiple pieces of content and products. Project Lumina is an open project for everyone. Anyone can take part, provided they give credit to the creators, to the project itself, and, where applicable, to any products already developed, can make fan-made content and release it as part of the Project Lumina universe. We also plan to launch an official public wiki where anyone can request to add their own creations, characters and stories.

**Lumina Aeterna** is an official Project Lumina product, consequently, the events, characters, species, universe, and the content are connected to Project Lumina and may appear again in other Project Lumina products.
